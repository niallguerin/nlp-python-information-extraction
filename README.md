# nlp-python-information-extraction
Data analytics project for NLP using Python for Information Extraction over footballers dataset.

This was an NLP project that covers following tasks:
- sentence segmentation, tokenization, and part-of-speech tagging
- information extraction for single Named Entity (NE) based on the POS tags
- information extraction for NEs at document level
- information extraction functions to obtain other entity attributes like player name, country of origin and relations like player-team, player-position
- information extraction using JSON-LD i.e. JSON-Linked Data https://json-ld.org/primer/latest/
- information extraction for custom relations of interest e.g. player awards

If you want to run it in PyCharm or similar IDE as raw .py file, export it from Anaconda Jupyter or Google Colab as a .py file. Modify the input path accordingly for the dataset file, so the program can load it from local file system and remember to install the Python libraries for nltk and numpy.
